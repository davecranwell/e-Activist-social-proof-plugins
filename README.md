# Social proof plugins

Engaging Networks predomininantly provide products to the charity sector for campaigning/fundraising purposes. Two of their products, E-Activist and Net Donor, store data captured into a database accessible via an API. The products' purpose is to provide a WYSIWYG-style interface through which donation and campaigning forms can be generated by the charity, which their supporters can then use to support a cause.

The products focus mainly on the creation of these forms and the storage of supporter data for the charities, they're less focussed on providing tools to increase social engagement of the campaigns themselves. 

These plugins try to bridge that gap somewhat by providing [Social Proof](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof) widgets, which can be used on any website, which show the campaigns in action.

2 plugins currently exist

* [Supporter list](#recent-supporter-list) A dynamic list of the supporters who have recently used any given campaigning form or forms
* [Thermometer](#thermometer) A "We have raised this much to rebuild the church roof" style thermometer to indicate the overall success of a campaign, relative to the campaign's goal

<p>One placeholder not related to e-Activist's fields is <span class="geshifilter"><code class="text geshifilter-text">{ago}</code></span>. This is used to output the data of the action in relative time format e.g "2 mins ago". The "2 mins " comes from the <span class="geshifilter"><code class="text geshifilter-text">{datetime}</code></span> but depending on the language of your page <span class="geshifilter"><code class="text geshifilter-text">{ago}</code></span> may have to come before or after "2 mins " so is provided as a separate placeholder to the <span class="geshifilter"><code class="text geshifilter-text">{datetime}</code></span>.</p>

<td>agoFormat</td>

<td>The name of the field containing the date to be formatted into the relative “2 mins ago” time. For almost all situations this does not need to be changed.</td>

### Example

```html
<script src="jquery.eactivist-supporterlist.js"></script>
<script>
  $(function(){
		$('.supporterlist').eActivistSupporterlist({
			token: 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxx',
			campaignId: 'xxxxx,xxxxx,xxxxx',
			format: '<span class="name">{vorname}</span> de {land} <span class="time">{ago} {datetime}</span>',
			agoText: 'Hace',
			agoFormatLabelsSingular: ['ano', 'mes', 'semanas', 'dia', 'hora', 'minutos', 'segundo'],
			agoFormatLabelsPlural: ['ano', 'mes', 'semanas', 'dia', 'hora', 'minutos', 'segundo'],
			count:5
		})
	});
</script>
<div class="supporterlist">
	<h3>People taking action</h3>
</div>
```

In the somewhat implausible example above, the relative time format has been configured for Spanish (note `{ago}` goes before the `{datetime}`) but the fields being pulled from the data API are `{vorname}` and `{land}` and evidently coming from a German database.
It would output something like

```html
<div class="supporterlist">
  <h3>People taking action</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="name">David</span> de England <span class="time">Hace 2 minutos</span></li>
		<li><span class="name">Luke</span> de Tatooine <span class="time">Hace 10 minutos</span></li>
		<li><span class="name">Darth</span> de Tatooine <span class="time">Hace 1 hora</span></li>
		<li><span class="name">Leia</span> de Alderaan <span class="time">Hace 5 hora</span></li>
		<li><span class="name">Han</span> de Corellia <span class="time">Hace 1 dia</span></li>
	</ul>
</div>
```

If for example you have received 200 supporters via a street campaign, and 1000 supporters via e-Activist, you would specify <code class="inline-code">initialValue: 200</code>.

### Markup

The contents of the element you choose with your jQuery selector should include the following classes. The types of elements you add these classes to is up to you, but obviously the markup must be conducive to the general concept of a thermometer which has a body and a "level" within that body.

<table style="width: 100%;" border="0" cellpadding="5">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>CLASS</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>t_body</td>
<td><strong>Mandatory</strong>. This element must wrap one with t_level applied. t_body is the main body of the thermometer - the part which "fills" with the progress bar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>t_level</td>
<td><strong>Mandatory.</strong> The themometer's "level" indicator. An element which is expanded/contracted to indicate the progress of the campaign towards its target.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>t_current</td>
<td>Any element with t_current applied to it will be populated with the value of the total current number of actions on the campaign (or totalled across multiple campaign IDs, if specified).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>t_target</td>
<td>Any element with t_target will be populated with the value entered in the <code class="inline-code">target</code> plugin option. Useful for generating messages like "X people have signed up, help us get to Y".</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
